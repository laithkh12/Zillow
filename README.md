## üñãÔ∏è Workflow
### 1. Scrape Property Data from Zillow
- The script sends a GET request to Zillow with headers mimicking a browser.
- It extracts:
  - Links to individual property listings.
  - Addresses of properties.
  - Prices of the listings.
- Cleans the scraped data for better readability.
### 2. Fill Google Form with Selenium
- Opens your Google Form using Chrome WebDriver.
- Enters the scraped data (address, price, link) into corresponding fields.
- Submits the form for each property.

## üîß Configuration Details
### Example Configuration:
Modify Zillow URL:
Replace "use Zillow.com" with the actual Zillow page link, e.g.:
```python
response = requests.get("https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/", headers=header)
```
Update Google Form Link:
Replace the placeholder with your Google Form link:
```python
driver.get("https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform")
```
Update XPATHs:
Adapt the XPATH selectors in the script to match your Google Form fields:
```python
address = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="field_xpath"]')
price = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="field_xpath"]')
link = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="field_xpath"]')
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Zillow's Anti-Bot Measures:
Avoid overloading the website with requests. Use appropriate headers and consider adding delays.
- Dynamic Selectors:
Zillow and Google Forms might update their HTML structure. Be ready to update CSS Selectors or XPATHs if the script stops working.
- Rate Limits:
Running the script too often may result in temporary IP bans. Use responsibly.
